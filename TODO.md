TODO:

	MOVE:

	RE-WORK:
	
	RENAME: 
	
	IMPLEMENT:
		async calls for by_date(), unique_co(), unique_cr(), unique_ci()
	
	
	Since api requests will be done anyway, make the functions to fire requests
		once the app is launched, before user selects dates.



DONE: 
		api_call() to the independent file.
		filter_data_by_date() to the filter_unique.py, and rename it to by_date()
		filter_unique.py into Class and rename to Filters.py
		filter_unique() to unique()
